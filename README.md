# Depth-First Search in a Country of Cities

## Description

## 2-Week Plan
### Week 1:
#### Day 1:
Define the City class with attributes like name, location, and a list of roads that connect it to other cities.

Define the Road class with attributes like start city, end city, and weight/distance.

Define the Graph class with a list of cities and methods to add cities and roads to the graph.

#### Day 2-3:

Implement a method to add cities to the Graph.

Implement a method to add roads to the Graph.

#### Day 4-5:

Implement the depth-first search algorithm to traverse the Graph from one city to another.

Test the search algorithm by manually verifying the output with a few sample cities.

#### Day 6:

Write Testers to verify the correctness of the methods.

Create test cases to check if the Graph, City, and Road classes are working correctly.

#### Day 7:

Implement a distance calculation method that uses the weight/distance of the roads between cities.

Test the distance calculation method with sample data.

### Week 2:
#### Day 8-9:
Create a user interface with a menu that allows the user to interactively select two cities.

Implement the driver that allows the user to choose two cities and see the distance between them.

Test the driver with sample data.

#### Day 10-11:
Refactor the code to optimize the Graph traversal algorithm for large graphs.

Use profiling tools to measure the performance of your code.

#### Day 12:
Add error handling to your code to handle edge cases.

Test the code with edge cases like invalid input data.

#### Day 13:
Implement a method to remove cities and roads from the Graph.

Test the remove method with sample data.

#### Day 14:
Perform final testing and debugging on your code.

Document your code and submit your project.
